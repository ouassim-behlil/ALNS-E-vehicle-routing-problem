## Installation

- Python 3.10+
- Create a virtual environment (optional) and install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you plan to use OR-Tools, ensure the package is installed for your platform (it is listed in requirements.txt). For plotting, a non-interactive backend is used when no DISPLAY is available.
